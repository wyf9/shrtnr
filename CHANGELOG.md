# Changelog

## 0.8.0

### Admin routes moved under `/_/admin/`

All admin pages now live at `/_/admin/*` instead of `/_/*`. This separates the Cloudflare Access protection boundary from the public API path, so API keys work without Access bypass rules.

- Admin pages: `/_/admin/dashboard`, `/_/admin/links`, `/_/admin/keys`, `/_/admin/settings`
- Admin AJAX endpoints: `/_/admin/api/*` (protected by Cloudflare Access at the edge)
- Public API: `/_/api/links/*` (Bearer token only, no JWT)
- MCP: `/_/mcp` (Bearer token only, no JWT)
- Legacy redirects from old `/_/dashboard`, `/_/links`, `/_/keys`, `/_/settings` paths (301)

### Auth model split

The admin UI and public API now use separate auth paths:

- **Admin**: identity extracted from Cloudflare Access JWT via `getIdentity()`. Falls back to "anonymous" when no JWT is present, so the app works without Access configured.
- **Public API/MCP**: `resolveAuth()` checks Bearer token only. No JWT logic.
- Removed `requireAdmin` (dead code). Cloudflare Access handles admin authorization at the edge.

### Identity abstraction

Replaced `getAuthenticatedEmail()` with `getIdentity()` returning `Identity { id, displayName }`. Tries the email claim first, falls back to sub. Decouples the app from email as the sole identity mechanism.

### Cloudflare Access configuration

Update your Access application path from `_/*` to `_/admin/*`. See README for details.

## 0.7.0

### MCP endpoint refactored into the Worker

The MCP server is now a built-in remote endpoint at `/_/mcp`, served directly by the Cloudflare Worker. Every shrtnr deployment includes the MCP server out of the box, authenticated with the same API keys as the admin API.

- Added `/_/mcp` endpoint using Cloudflare's `agents` SDK with `createMcpHandler()`
- MCP tools call the service layer directly for lower latency
- Stateless per-request design: no Durable Objects required
- Consolidated the `mcp/` directory into the main application
- Simplified CI workflows to reflect the single-package structure

### Migration from `@oddbit/shrtnr-mcp`

Replace `npx @oddbit/shrtnr-mcp` with a remote MCP connection to your shrtnr deployment. See the MCP section in `README.md` for client configuration examples.

## 0.6.3

## 0.6.2

- Replaced language picker toggle buttons with a dropdown select that scales to any number of languages

## 0.6.1

### Security
- Restricted link URLs to http and https schemes, rejecting javascript:, data:, file:, and ftp: targets
- Capped slug length at 128 characters to prevent oversized allocations

### Docs
- Added multi-language and API key auth to README feature list

## 0.6.0

- Added internationalization (i18n) with English, Indonesian, and Swedish
- Language preference stored in `user_preferences` table, English as default
- Language selector on settings page shows localized and native language names
- Extracted all hardcoded UI strings into translation files
- Client-side strings translated via serialized translation object
- Locale-aware date formatting and country name display

## 0.5.0

- Migrated admin UI from monolithic SPA to Hono JSX server-rendered pages
- Replaced 1500-line template-literal file with modular page components
- Admin routes moved from `/_/admin/*` to `/_/*` with legacy redirects
- Extracted CSS and client JS into dedicated modules
- Added Hono as a dependency for routing and JSX rendering
- Updated copyright notices to 2026

## 0.4.4

- Dashboard stat cards (Total Links, Total Clicks) sit side by side on mobile instead of stacking full-width
- Wide dashboard cards (Recent Links, Most Clicked, Top Sources) span the full mobile grid
- Scaled down dashboard stat numbers for mobile screens
- Link items stay horizontal on mobile with a compact click count on the right
- URLs wrap naturally instead of being truncated

## 0.4.3

- Fixed mobile layout across all pages: dashboard, links, API keys, and settings now render correctly on narrow screens
- Dashboard bento grid stacks to a single column on mobile
- Links toolbar wraps gracefully with full-width "New Link" button
- Link items stack vertically so URLs and click counts stay visible
- API keys table switches to a stacked card layout per row
- Settings and integrations columns stack on small viewports
- Prevented horizontal overflow on the main content area

## 0.4.2

- Settings page now shows an Integrations section with links to the TypeScript SDK and MCP Server npm packages

## 0.4.1

- Deploy script resolves the D1 `database_id` at build time via `wrangler d1 list`, removing the need for a hardcoded ID in `wrangler.toml`
- Works for both the Deploy to Cloudflare button (forks) and Import from Git (existing repos)

## 0.4.0

- Replaced runtime migration system with Cloudflare's standard `wrangler d1 migrations apply` during deploy
- The `deploy` script in `package.json` now runs migrations before deploying, which Cloudflare auto-detects for one-click deploy and Workers Builds
- Migration command references the D1 binding name (`DB`) instead of the database name, so it works regardless of what each user names their database
- Removed `src/migrate.ts`: no application-level migration code runs at request time

## 0.3.4

- Automatic database migrations: the Worker applies pending schema changes on cold start, no CLI commands or dashboard configuration needed
- Compatible with existing deployments: detects migrations already applied by wrangler and skips them
- Reverted deploy command to plain `wrangler deploy` since migrations are now handled at runtime

## 0.3.3

- Fixed D1 migration gap: deploy script now applies pending migrations before deploying the Worker
- Updated README: one-click deploy instructions now include the required deploy command change in Workers Builds settings

## 0.3.2

### Bug fixes
- Analytics endpoint now returns 404 for nonexistent links instead of 200 with empty data

### Internal
- Extracted shared `ServiceResult` type, `json()`, and `fromServiceResult()` into `src/api/response.ts`, removing duplication across 8 files
- Removed dead `Click` type, unused `incrementClickCount` function, and redundant `top_links` type annotation
- Added 14 API tests: read-scope write denial, create-scope read denial, vanity slug redirects, invalid JSON body handling, and 404s for nonexistent resources

## 0.3.1

- Clarified Workers Builds setup: deploy command, build-time variables, and where to find the D1 database ID

## 0.3.0

### Mobile UI
- Responsive layout with slide-in drawer navigation on small screens
- Hamburger menu button in sticky mobile header
- Long URLs truncate instead of overflowing
- Progress bars hidden on mobile; numeric values remain visible
- API keys table scrolls horizontally rather than breaking layout

### Integrations
- Published `@oddbit/shrtnr-sdk` npm package for programmatic link management
- Published `@oddbit/shrtnr-mcp` npm package exposing link management to AI assistants via MCP stdio transport

### CI
- Shared release scripts in `scripts/` (`extract-changelog.sh`, `detect-releases.sh`)
- Unified `release-packages.yml` workflow covers both SDK and MCP releases via a dynamic matrix

## 0.2.0

### API keys
- App-managed API keys with SHA-256 hashed storage
- Dual authentication: Cloudflare Access (admin) and Bearer token (API keys)
- Scope-based authorization: create, read, or both
