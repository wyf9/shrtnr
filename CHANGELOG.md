# Changelog

## 0.11.0

### MCP

- MCP landing page and OAuth approval dialog extracted into dedicated modules with shared design tokens.
- MCP OAuth flow verified end-to-end with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, MCP Inspector, and VS Code Copilot.
- Deploy script warns when Cloudflare's "Block AI bots" rule is active, which silently drops MCP connections from AI assistants.
- README documents the required "Block AI bots" disable step as part of MCP setup.

### Admin UI

- Links page uses a hero shorten bar instead of a modal for creating links.
- API Keys page shows an SDK note with npm install instructions.
- Settings page links to release notes for the current version.

### Branding

- SVG logotype and logo assets for light and dark backgrounds, served from `/public/`.
- Admin layout and standalone pages use the theme-aware logotype.
- Removed all inlined SVG markup in favor of `<img>` references to static assets.

### Deploy

- Deploy script resolves both D1 and KV namespace IDs at deploy time. Hardcoded IDs removed from `wrangler.toml`.
- KV namespace created automatically on first deploy.
- Static assets (icons, manifest, robots.txt) moved to `public/` and served by Wrangler directly. Removed hand-rolled asset-serving code.

### Internal

- Standalone page styles split into composable `standaloneBaseStyles` and `standaloneCenteredStyles` exports.
- All dependencies updated.

## 0.10.0

### MCP endpoint moved to OAuth via Cloudflare Access (breaking)

The MCP endpoint at `/_/mcp` now uses OAuth authentication backed by Cloudflare Access for SaaS, replacing API key Bearer tokens. This enables native connectivity from claude.ai custom connectors and other OAuth-capable MCP clients.

**Breaking changes:**

- **API keys no longer accepted on `/_/mcp`.** MCP clients must authenticate through the OAuth flow. Users sign in via Cloudflare Access.
- **New infrastructure requirements.** The Worker needs a KV namespace (`OAUTH_KV`) for OAuth session state, a Durable Object for MCP sessions, and six secrets from the Cloudflare Access for SaaS application.
- **New dependency:** `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider` handles the OAuth 2.1 protocol.

**Unchanged:**

- API key authentication for `/_/api/*` (SDK and programmatic access) remains the same.
- Admin UI authentication remains external (Cloudflare Access policies, IP rules, etc.).

### Setup requirements

1. Create a SaaS OIDC application in Cloudflare Zero Trust.
2. Set six Worker secrets from the SaaS app: `ACCESS_CLIENT_ID`, `ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ACCESS_TOKEN_URL`, `ACCESS_AUTHORIZATION_URL`, `ACCESS_JWKS_URL`, `COOKIE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.
3. Deploy. The KV namespace for OAuth state is created automatically on first deploy. See the MCP section in `README.md`.

## 0.9.0

### Removed Cloudflare Access coupling (breaking)

The app no longer reads or depends on Cloudflare Access JWTs. All CF Access awareness has been stripped from the codebase. Protecting the admin UI is now the deployer's responsibility: use CF Access policies, IP restrictions, Cloudflare Tunnel, or any approach that suits your setup.

**Breaking changes:**

- **API keys are ownerless.** The `email` column is gone. All admin users manage all keys. Existing keys continue to work for authentication.
- **Preferences moved to browser cookies.** Theme and language are stored as `theme` and `lang` cookies. The `user_preferences` table is dropped. Users will need to re-select their theme after upgrading.
- **SDK `AccessTokenAuth` removed.** The SDK only supports `{ apiKey: "sk_..." }` auth. If you used `{ accessToken: "..." }`, switch to an API key.
- **`/_/admin/api/preferences` endpoints removed.** The client now writes cookies directly.
- **`Identity` type and `getIdentity()` removed** from the auth module.

### Migration notes

- Run the new `0004_remove_auth_scoping.sql` migration (applied automatically on deploy).
- Update any CF Access application path if you still want Access protection.
- No changes needed for API key authentication: existing Bearer tokens keep working.

## 0.8.0

### Admin routes moved under `/_/admin/`

All admin pages now live at `/_/admin/*` instead of `/_/*`. This separates the Cloudflare Access protection boundary from the public API path, so API keys work without Access bypass rules.

- Admin pages: `/_/admin/dashboard`, `/_/admin/links`, `/_/admin/keys`, `/_/admin/settings`
- Admin AJAX endpoints: `/_/admin/api/*` (protected by Cloudflare Access at the edge)
- Public API: `/_/api/links/*` (Bearer token only, no JWT)
- MCP: `/_/mcp` (Bearer token only, no JWT)
- Legacy redirects from old `/_/dashboard`, `/_/links`, `/_/keys`, `/_/settings` paths (301)

### Auth model split

The admin UI and public API now use separate auth paths:

- **Admin**: identity extracted from Cloudflare Access JWT via `getIdentity()`. Falls back to "anonymous" when no JWT is present, so the app works without Access configured.
- **Public API/MCP**: `resolveAuth()` checks Bearer token only. No JWT logic.
- Removed `requireAdmin` (dead code). Cloudflare Access handles admin authorization at the edge.

### Identity abstraction

Replaced `getAuthenticatedEmail()` with `getIdentity()` returning `Identity { id, displayName }`. Tries the email claim first, falls back to sub. Decouples the app from email as the sole identity mechanism.

### Cloudflare Access configuration

Update your Access application path from `_/*` to `_/admin/*`. See README for details.

## 0.7.0

### MCP endpoint refactored into the Worker

The MCP server is now a built-in remote endpoint at `/_/mcp`, served directly by the Cloudflare Worker. Every shrtnr deployment includes the MCP server out of the box, authenticated with the same API keys as the admin API.

- Added `/_/mcp` endpoint using Cloudflare's `agents` SDK with `createMcpHandler()`
- MCP tools call the service layer directly for lower latency
- Stateless per-request design: no Durable Objects required
- Consolidated the `mcp/` directory into the main application
- Simplified CI workflows to reflect the single-package structure

### Migration from `@oddbit/shrtnr-mcp`

Replace `npx @oddbit/shrtnr-mcp` with a remote MCP connection to your shrtnr deployment. See the MCP section in `README.md` for client configuration examples.

## 0.4.4

- Dashboard stat cards (Total Links, Total Clicks) sit side by side on mobile instead of stacking full-width
- Wide dashboard cards (Recent Links, Most Clicked, Top Sources) span the full mobile grid
- Scaled down dashboard stat numbers for mobile screens
- Link items stay horizontal on mobile with a compact click count on the right
- URLs wrap naturally instead of being truncated

## 0.4.3

## 0.4.2

- Settings page now shows an Integrations section with links to the TypeScript SDK and MCP Server npm packages

## 0.4.1

- Deploy script resolves the D1 `database_id` at build time via `wrangler d1 list`, removing the need for a hardcoded ID in `wrangler.toml`
- Works for both the Deploy to Cloudflare button (forks) and Import from Git (existing repos)

## 0.4.0

- Replaced runtime migration system with Cloudflare's standard `wrangler d1 migrations apply` during deploy
- The `deploy` script in `package.json` now runs migrations before deploying, which Cloudflare auto-detects for one-click deploy and Workers Builds
- Migration command references the D1 binding name (`DB`) instead of the database name, so it works regardless of what each user names their database
- Removed `src/migrate.ts`: no application-level migration code runs at request time

## 0.3.4

- Automatic database migrations: the Worker applies pending schema changes on cold start, no CLI commands or dashboard configuration needed
- Compatible with existing deployments: detects migrations already applied by wrangler and skips them
- Reverted deploy command to plain `wrangler deploy` since migrations are now handled at runtime
